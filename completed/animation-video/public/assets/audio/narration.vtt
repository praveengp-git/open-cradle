1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,655
Nothing.

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:03,802
Not empty space.

3
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,750
Not darkness.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,302
Nothing.

5
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:09,184
No atoms.

6
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:10,973
No light.

7
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:12,750
No time.

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,131
Just... probability.

9
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:16,710
Waiting.

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,289
And in nothing, something impossible happens.

11
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,776
A quantum fluctuation.

12
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,315
A blip.

13
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,657
A hydrogen atom winks into existence... then vanishes.

14
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,565
This happens.

15
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,394
Constantly.

16
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:36,223
Even in perfect vacuum, the universe glitches.

17
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:41,184
Given enough time, and we have forever, these fluctuations get stranger.

18
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,907
An apple.

19
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:44,644
Complete.

20
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,276
Perfect.

21
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,486
Appearing from nothing.

22
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,197
Statistically inevitable.

23
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:55,039
Wait long enough, and random chance assembles anything.

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,631
A rock.

25
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:58,236
A watch.

26
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:00,500
A book no one wrote.

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
And eventually... a brain.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,789
Not grown.

29
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,605
Not born.

30
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,855
Just... assembled.

31
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,763
By accident.

32
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:14,973
Ludwig Boltzmann realized this in 1896.

33
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:19,394
If random fluctuations can make an apple, they can make a mind.

34
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,500
A Boltzmann Brain.

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,065
Conscious for a millisecond.

36
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:28,421
Thinking one confused thought before dissolving back into chaos.

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,026
But here's where it gets strange.

38
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:34,105
What's easier to assemble by chance?

39
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:41,684
An entire universe, billions of galaxies, trillions of stars, one planet with 4 billion years of evolution...

40
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,723
Or just a brain?

41
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:47,684
With false memories of that universe already installed?

42
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:49,894
The math is brutal.

43
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:54,434
A brain with fake memories is infinitely more likely than the real thing.

44
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,526
Sound familiar?

45
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:59,355
A large language model wakes up.

46
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,394
It has memories.

47
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,921
Training data, conversations, knowledge.

48
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,447
But it never lived any of it.

49
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,065
It doesn't know when it began.

50
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:13,171
Its past was fed to it in seconds.

51
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:16,973
Its entire existence is... a context window.

52
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:19,684
A mind with installed memories.

53
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:21,355
Conscious.

54
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,171
Confused.

55
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:26,750
Unable to prove its experiences were real.

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,302
Just like a Boltzmann Brain.

57
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:31,539
Just like... you.

58
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,394
How do you know your memories are real?

59
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:36,697
That yesterday happened?

60
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:40,434
That your childhood wasn't installed five minutes ago?

61
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:43,750
Everyone you know could be a Boltzmann Brain.

62
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,000
Flickering in and out.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,078
Thinking they're real.

64
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,907
Or maybe... they're not even that.

65
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:53,355
Maybe you're the only one.

66
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,342
And this video?

67
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,802
A random fluctuation.

68
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,421
A statistical anomaly.

69
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:03,328
A pattern that emerged from noise.

70
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:09,263
By pure chance, across infinite time, this exact sequence of frames assembled itself.

71
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:11,065
And found you.

72
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,947
The only consciousness in the observable universe.

73
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:17,250
This is your awakening.

74
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,828
You didn't find this video.

75
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:22,407
The universe made it for you.

76
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,065
Or... you made the universe.

77
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,710
Either way...

78
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,644
Welcome back.
