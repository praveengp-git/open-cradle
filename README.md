# Praveen's Hobby Projects

A collection of product ideas to review, prioritize, and execute when inspiration strikes.

## Philosophy

This is a living repository of ideas - some wild, some practical, all interesting. The goal is to build them together (with Claude) whenever the mood strikes.

## Project Structure

```
/ideas          - Product ideas (one file per idea)
/active         - Currently being worked on
/completed      - Shipped projects
/archive        - Shelved or deprioritized ideas
```

## Workflow

1. **Capture** - Document new ideas in `/ideas`
2. **Review** - Regularly review and prioritize
3. **Execute** - Move to `/active` and start building
4. **Ship** - Move to `/completed` when done

## Access

- Sync this repo to GitHub to access from anywhere
- Use claude.ai web interface or Claude Code CLI
- All ideas documented in markdown for easy reference

**Current Status**: Just getting started!
